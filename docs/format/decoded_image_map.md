# Decoded Image Map (Canonical)

> The `.xy` file after its 8-byte header is one RLE stream (see
> `docs/format/record_structure.md` §0 and `xy/rle.py`). This document
> maps the **decoded RAM image** — the firmware's project struct — built
> from a corpus-wide join of decoded diffs × the one-off change log
> (2026-06-09). Offsets are for baseline `unnamed 1.xy`
> (decoded size 289,521 bytes) unless marked track-relative.

## Image Layout

```
0x00000          global header            (3,449 bytes)
0x00D79 + k*0x45D4   track struct k=0..15 (17,876 bytes each)
end − 53         footer: song table       (53 bytes)
```

`3,449 + 16×17,876 + 53 = 289,521` exactly. Adding a pattern inserts one
more 17,876-byte struct (clones in raw space were full copies because the
struct *is* the pattern). Track structs grow only via count-prefixed
vectors (notes: +12 bytes each).

## Global Header Fields

| offset | field | evidence |
|---|---|---|
| 0x00 | tempo, u16 LE tenths of BPM (+ related byte at 0x04 region) | u4, u5 |
| 0x03 | groove type | u11, u12 |
| 0x04 | metronome/click volume | u10 |
| 0x06 | song/scene count-ish (songs: u13; scenes: 152/153 touch 0x06–0x07) | u13, u152 |
| 0x07 | selected song/scene ordinal | u149, u151 |
| 0x55–0x64 | per-track MIDI channel array, 1 byte/track (T1=0x55 … T16=0x64) | u41, u54 |
| 0x68 / 0x6C / 0x70 | master EQ low / mid / high (4-byte fields) | u14, u15, u16 |

(Scene records — the 33-byte structs of `record_structure.md` §4 — also
live in the global region in scene-bearing files.)

## Track Struct (track-relative offsets; track base = header byte 0)

| offset | field | evidence |
|---|---|---|
| +0x00 | pattern count (leader) | header decode |
| +0x01 | bar count (`bars<<4` nibble byte) | u17–u19 |
| +0x02 | 0xF0 marker | — |
| +0x03 | signature `00 00 00 [scale] FF 00 FC 00` | — |
| +0x06 | **track scale** (0x01=½, 0x03=1, 0x05=2, 0x0E=16) | u20–u22 |
| +0x11 | u16: **8 = pristine, 0 = edited** — the raw "type 0x05/0x07 + `08 00` padding" was this field's RLE shadow; sticky (never returns to 8) | u51, u53, every edit file |
| +0x1C | M4/LFO type selector (5 bytes change on LFO swap) | u32 |
| +0x20 | M4 page on/off | u31, u33 |
| +0x21 | filter type (SVF/Ladder) | u28 |
| +0x25 | filter on/off | u29 |
| +0x3057 + 16×(step−1) | **step-component slot, 16 bytes per step**, one byte per component type within the slot (portamento +9, bend +10, tonality +11, jump +12, param +13, conditional +14, …) | u8/u9, u59–u77 |
| +0x3857 | engine parameter block: 4-byte values (param1 +0x3857, param4 +0x3863, …) | u23–u25, u96 |
| +0x3877 | M2 amp envelope ADSR (16 bytes) | u26 |
| +0x3897 | M3 filter knobs (16 bytes) | u30 |
| +0x38B7 | M4 values (16 bytes + extras) | u32, u33 |
| +0x38D7 | filter envelope ADSR (16 bytes) | u27 |
| +0x3900–0x393B | modulation routing matrix (modwheel/aftertouch/pitchbend targets & amounts) | u83, u84 |
| +0x3919 / +0x392F | velocity sensitivity / track high-pass filter | u82, u40 |
| +0x3CBF | 2-byte UI-state (last-touched?) — co-changes with edits | u40, u66, u82 |
| ~+0x456F | **note event area**: `[count u8]` + 12-byte note records `{u32 tick; u32 gate; u8 note; u8 vel; u8 flags[2]}` (tick 480/16th, gate 240 = default) | u81 decode |
| end | trailing zero region (raw-space "tail byte" = its run extension) | — |

**Aux tracks**: T15 = FX1, T16 = FX2 — FX type changes substitute in the
same engine-param offsets (+0x3857…) of those structs (u36, u37).
Engine swaps are size-preserving (param block fixed-size, u34).

## Footer (last 53 bytes)

The 14-slot song table (`record_structure.md` §5):
`[scene_count][scene_ids…][loop_word]` per song; song 2/3 edits land at
FOOTER+0x2/+0xA (u149, u151–153).

## Method

`tools/analysis/decoded_diff.py` against the baseline, joined with
`src/one-off-changes-from-default/op-xy_project_change_log.md`. Most
one-off files are pure substitutions of 1–16 bytes at the offsets above;
files that add notes/patterns grow by exactly 12 / 17,876 bytes.

## The "Event Type" Byte: RESOLVED — it never existed

The legacy event-type taxonomy (raw bytes 0x1C–0x2D; "preset-specific
factory IDs"; crash #2) is an RLE artifact. In decoded space there is no
type byte: the note vector is `[count u8]` at **track+0x456F** followed
by 12-byte records, preceded by a zero gap that runs back to the end of
the **preset-name string** (~track+0x4547–0x4550). The raw "type byte"
is that zero-run's extension count: `gap − 2`. Verified 24/24 across
unnamed 2/81/91/92/93/113/116/117 — e.g. "0x25" = 39-zero gap ending at
'p' (drum/boo**p**), "0x21" = 35 ending at 'r' (shoulde**r**), and the
"0x2D engine-swap fallback" = 47-zero gap ending at '/' (a stripped
preset path). **The type was the length of the preset's filename.**
Crash #2's mechanism: writing "0x21" on T1 claims a 35-zero gap where
the struct has 39 → the count lands 4 bytes early → `fixed_vector`
assert. The legacy event-form taxonomy (inline / fine-tick /
pointer-tail / hybrid) is likewise just tick/gate values changing the
RLE shapes.

## Image-Based Authoring (validated)

`xy/image_writer.py` edits the decoded image the way the firmware would
(set fields, splice vector elements, flip the pristine flag) and
re-encodes. **Byte-exact replication of device-saved captures:**
unnamed 2, 81, 19, 92 (`tests/test_image_writer.py`). Files that don't
replicate from their change-log description alone differ only in UI
session bytes (e.g. last-touched fields at +0x3CBF) — the file
remembering the musician's hands, not format semantics.

Device probe pack (untested): `output/image-probes/01..03` — includes
the note==velocity probe written with its RLE extension byte
(`3c 3c 00`), which the old "firmware bug" model predicts crashes and
this model predicts loads.

## Tier-1 Field Sweeps (2026-06-09, corpus-only)

### Step-component slot — FULLY DECODED

16 bytes per step at track+0x3057 + 16×(step−1):

```c
struct StepComponents {
    u16 enabled_mask;   // LE bitfield, one bit per component type
    u8  value[14];      // one config byte per type, same bit order
};
```

| bit | component | value example (corpus) |
|-----|-----------|------------------------|
| 0 | pulse | 01 = 1 repeat; 00 = max/random (u8/9/59/60) |
| 1 | hold | 01 = min (u61) |
| 2 | multiply | 04 = ÷4 (u66) |
| 3 | velocity | 00 = random (u67) |
| 4 | ramp up | 08 = 4 steps/3 oct (u68) |
| 5 | ramp down | 02 = 3 steps/1 oct (u69) |
| 6 | random | 03 = 4 steps/1 oct (u70) |
| 7 | portamento | 07 = 70% (u71) |
| 8 | bend | 01 = up/down shape (u72) |
| 9 | tonality | 04 = +5th (u73) |
| 10 | jump | 04 = →step 13 from 9 (u74) |
| 11 | param | 04 = 4 toggles (u75) |
| 12 | conditional A | 02 = 1:2 (u76) |
| 13 | conditional B / trigger | 04 = every 4th (u62); 09 = 1:9 (u77) |

`ff 3f` = all 14 enabled (u63). The legacy "two banks / alloc-byte
formula / only steps 1&9 work" lore was RLE artifacts plus our own
encoder bugs.

### P-lock (per-step parameter lock) table — structure decoded

Per-step lock rows at **track+0x2A0**, **84 bytes per step** (×64),
**u16 cell per parameter column** (42 columns):

```
cell(step, param) = track + 0x2A0 + 84·(step−1) + 2·param_col
```

Verified with the device-passed `plock_drum_t2.xy` (alternating
256/32767 on known steps, uniform 84 stride) and the cc_map captures.
The column index is the device's master per-track parameter
enumeration (u16 byte-offsets within the row, from u121/123/124/126):

| offset | col | parameter | | offset | col | parameter |
|--------|-----|-----------|-|--------|-----|-----------|
| 0  | 0  | Volume       | | 38 | 19 | Filter Env amount |
| 2  | 1  | Param 1      | | 40 | 20 | Key tracking |
| 4  | 2  | Param 2      | | 42 | 21 | Send Ext |
| 6  | 3  | Param 3      | | 44 | 22 | Send Tape |
| 8  | 4  | Param 4      | | 46 | 23 | Send FX I |
| 18 | 9  | Amp Attack   | | 48 | 24 | Send FX II |
| 20 | 10 | Amp Decay    | | ~50/52 | 25/26 | LFO param/dest (paired field 0x162F) |
| 22 | 11 | Amp Sustain  | | 82 | 41 | Pan |
| 24 | 12 | Amp Release  | | | | |

Completed from u122/u123 (same-project diff isolates each lane):
Poly=+26, Porto=+28, PitchBend=+30, EngineVol=+32, Cutoff=+34,
Reso=+36, FilterEnvA/D/S/R=+66/68/70/72. CC9 "mute" is never recorded,
matching the capture notes. The old raw-space "param_id" bytes and
3/5/9/18-byte entry formats were RLE artifacts.

### Engine / preset region

- **Engine ID at track+0x14** (u85: 0x12 Prism → 0x1F Wavetable;
  matches the known engine-id enum).
- **Preset path string at track+0x453F** (null-padded; `bass/shoulder`
  baseline T3; engine swap w/o preset leaves a bare `/` — the source of
  the "0x2D fallback event type" artifact). The string's end is where
  the pre-count zero gap begins.
- Engine parameter cells: 4-byte values from +0x3857 (current values;
  preset load rewrites them — copy from a corpus donor per preset).

### Sample table (drum/sampler) — structure decoded

**24 slots × 128 bytes at track+0x395F** (= the 24-key drum limit),
sample path string inside each slot, per-sample params in the remaining
slot bytes (tune/level/envelope fields not yet itemized). Preset name
field follows the table. (The "amb kit" sampler corpus referenced in
older notes is not present in the repo; slot internals can be mapped
from baseline + kit-change one-offs when needed.)

### Preset assignment (validated)

Loading a kit/preset = copying the donor's preset-identity regions into
the target struct at the same offsets:
`(0x13–0x2A0) ∪ (0x3457–0x456F) ∪ (0x4570–end)` — i.e. everything
except header, pristine flag, p-lock table, step components, and the
note vector. Validated against u116 (boop kit on T4/T7/T8): donor-copy
reproduces the device file except UI-session bytes.
`ImageProject.set_preset()` implements this.

## Open

- Sample-slot internal fields (tune/level/envelope offsets) — no
  sample-edit captures exist in the corpus; needs one device capture
  session (edit one sample's tune/level on a kit, save, diff).
- UI session fields (+0x3B3F/+0x3CBF/+0x3DBF/+0x423F families) —
  imitate, don't derive.
- Naive differ misaligns after insertions; an alignment-aware decoded
  diff would clean up note-file attributions.
