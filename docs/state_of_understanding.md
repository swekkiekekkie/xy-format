# State of Understanding

A running ledger of what we believe about the `.xy` format at points in
time: what got sorted, what we currently think, what remains mysterious,
and what would falsify or confirm the current theory. Append a new dated
entry when the picture meaningfully changes; do not rewrite old entries
(they are the record of what we thought and when).

## 2026-06-09 — The serialization-model reframe

### One-sentence status

We found the serialization *paradigm* — the file is byte-level
RLE-compressed little-endian C structs — which retrodicts five months of
device experiments including most of the crash ledger; it is a reading
breakthrough, not yet a writing one.

### Settled (corpus/device-validated)

1. **Record boundaries.** The 4-byte "track preamble" was misframed: the
   leading byte is the *previous* record's trailing byte; `count/bars/F0`
   head the next record; clones carry no count byte. The entire
   "preamble state machine" (0x64 propagation, T5 exemption, 0xB5
   multi-pattern marker — ~50 rules at 98.2%) dissolves into local
   struct content. Evidence: 687/687 deviations across 206 files.
2. **Pre-track scene records.** One RLE-compressed 33-byte struct
   (`selected_pattern[16] + mute[16] + flags`), record 0 = live
   selection. Replaces the descriptor Scheme A/B apparatus, v56/v57,
   tokens, short/collapsed forms, and the bleez "record families".
   Evidence: 245/246 files byte-exact; the one rejected file
   (`bleez34.xy`) is the one the device also rejects.
3. **Scene-edit crash mechanics** (crashes #8/#12, probes 59–92): a
   pre-track edit is safe iff the stream still decodes to n×33 values
   with the tail byte equal to n. Retroactively predicts every
   pass/crash in those probe packs.
4. **Crashes #3/#5/#6** (preamble/T5/T9 families): tail bytes are
   zero-fill run counts of each record's fixed trailing region — purely
   local; the cross-track rules were artifacts. 2,224 records, zero
   unexplained cells.
5. **Song table.** File footer = 14 slots of
   `[scene_count][scene_ids…][loop_word]`; loop word `00 01` = on,
   `01 00` = off (unnamed 150 nl/lp device A/B). Pre-track byte 0x11 =
   selected song − 1.
6. **Performance automation lanes** (the 0x60/0x61 tails):
   `[first_lane][count][v0 u16][vmax u16]` + `(t u16, v u16)` keyframes;
   lanes PB/MW/AT (vmax 8191/254/254); static lanes count=1. unnamed
   106–109 MIDI-harness ramps decode to exact 480-tick linear keyframes.
7. **Track scale** is the 4th signature byte (0x03=1×, 0x05=2×,
   0x0E=16×, 0x01=½×) — the "signature" is not all magic.

### Believed (explained in principle, not byte-exact-proven)

- **The whole-file RLE claim**: every track body is the same RLE over
  serialized structs. Converging evidence: gate "token" `F0 00 00 01` =
  u32 gate of 240 ticks; tick "flag bytes" = zero-run extension counts
  inside u32 ticks; chord "separators" = zero runs; decoded body sizes
  grow exactly ~12 bytes/note (RAM note struct
  `u32 tick; u32 gate; u8 note; u8 vel; u8 ×2`); tail bytes derive as
  zero-fill extensions (0x63 vs 0x64 = one extra trailing event byte;
  0x92 vs 0x8A = 8-byte preset field zeroed). **Not yet held to the
  round-trip standard.**
- **note==velocity crash** = an unescaped RLE pair; correct encoding is
  `[n][n][00]`. The velocity nudge treats the symptom. Untested on
  device.
- **Crashes #9/#10** (scene track-generalization / insert probes):
  failure mode is byte-poking inside an RLE stream; individual artifacts
  not yet re-decoded to show each specific corruption.
- **P-lock "val ≥ 256" rule (crash #10 family)** likely the same pair
  phenomenon (val_hi=0 changing byte patterns); not re-derived.

### Mysteries (genuinely unknown)

- **Decoded track-struct field map** — engine params, sample tables
  (the `FF 00 00` lattices), step components, p-locks as fixed-offset
  fields in decoded space. Most of the file by volume.
- **Event type bytes 0x1C–0x2D**: why presets carry different type bytes
  and what the loader selects on them (crash #2 still only empirical).
- **Type 0x05/0x07 + `08 00` padding** (crash #1 root): obeyed, not
  understood; likely falls out of the struct decode.
- **Pointer-21 / live-recorded note storage** (unnamed 39/120): lanes
  decoded, live note events not.
- **Sparse multi-pattern instability** (crash #4/#6 family, u01 vs u02):
  not re-derived; suspected to reduce to scene/selection-record
  consistency, but that is a guess.
- **RLE codec corner cases**: decoder state after an extension byte,
  runs > 257, and scope boundaries (the unnamed 109 lane boundary needed
  count-driven reading, not naive RLE). These details decide whether a
  byte-exact encoder is possible.
- **Pre-track fixed-header fields** beyond tempo/scene ordinals; handle
  table semantics; the one extra byte in `unnamed 154b`/`unnamed 156`.

### Practical capability check

"Can we generate files now?" — **Same capability as before this work,
transformed prospects.** Writers still use validated scaffold paths.
What changed is that we now know *why* those paths work and why the
others crashed.

### Next decisive test

Build the full-file RLE codec and run the **246-file round-trip**:
decode → re-encode → byte-identical. Pass ⇒ authoring becomes struct
construction (archaeology over). Fail ⇒ the failures point exactly at
the remaining unknown scopes. Secondary device test: write
note==velocity with the proper `00` extension byte.

### Pointers

## Pre-2026-06-09 — The compositional-serializer era (for contrast)

What we thought before the reframe (preserved so the shift is legible):

- The format was modeled as "baseline scaffold + feature-driven edit
  atoms"; pre-track inserts were catalogued per topology (descriptor
  Schemes A/B) rather than derived.
- Preamble byte[0] was modeled as a cross-track state machine (98.2%
  accuracy with exception families), with hardcoded exemptions (T5) and
  global markers (0xB5).
- Scene records were three encoding "families" (tag/alt/matrix + bleez)
  with partially-understood field couplings; single-byte edits were
  device-tested one at a time, crashing often.
- note==velocity was catalogued as a firmware parser bug, worked around
  with a velocity nudge.
- Gate/tick encodings were treated as token systems with width flags.
- Authoring safety came from byte-exact mimicry of device captures
  (scaffolds, transplants, strict-mode lookups) — effective, but every
  new topology required new device probes.

The legacy docs (`descriptor_encoding.md`, `preamble_state_machine.md`,
`scenes_songs.md` §§5–23) remain useful as device-outcome ledgers even
though their *models* are superseded.
