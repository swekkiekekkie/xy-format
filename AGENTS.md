# AGENTS: OP-XY Reverse Engineering

## Mission
- Decode the `.xy` project format so we can parse, edit, and eventually write valid projects off-device.
- Keep stable format knowledge in `docs/format/*` and historical findings in `docs/logs/*`.
- Prefer byte-accurate, device-validated rules over heuristics.
- Preserve unknown bytes for round-trip safety until decoded.

## Operating Norms
- Keep generated device test filenames short and sortable.
- When proposing multiple files to test, the intended test order must match alphabetical filename order.
- Use prefixes like `a_`, `b_`, `c_` or `01_`, `02_`, `03_`.
- Record device outcomes with `python tools/corpus_lab.py record <file.xy> <pass|crash|untested> --note "..."`.
- Add new stable findings to the relevant file in `docs/format/*`; add dated narrative/debugging context to `docs/logs/*`.
- Every device crash must be captured with artifact + metadata + follow-up pass file using `docs/workflows/crash_capture.md`.
- Add or update the corresponding entry in `docs/debug/crashes.md` for every crash and every verified fix.
- Do not grow this file with chronology; keep this file as index + operating rules.

## Working Assumption: Compositional Serializer
- Treat firmware save behavior as **baseline scaffold serialization + a small set of feature-driven structural edits**, not full-byte recomputation.
- For pre-track specifically, assume most files are explained by zero-to-few edit atoms (commonly insert/replace near `0x56-0x58`) until evidence disproves it.
- Prefer hypotheses that can be expressed as deterministic operation scripts (`insert`, `replace`, rare `delete`) over opaque heuristic byte patching.
- When a file does not fit the current operation catalog, treat it as a high-value outlier and isolate the minimal structural delta before adding new rules.
- Keep undecoded regions opaque for round-trip safety; only promote rules to `docs/format/*` after corpus-backed checks (and device validation when possible).

## Hypothesis-Driven Modeling Loop
1. Start with the compositional assumption and test against corpus before proposing new global structure theories.
2. Use `python tools/hypothesis_tests.py h7-compositional` to measure whether a proposed pre-track model is explained by repeated structural ops.
3. Use `python tools/hypothesis_tests.py event-models` / `event-dispatch` to score serializer hypotheses against wild files.
4. Prefer the smallest model family that explains the largest corpus share; keep unresolved buckets explicit as tracked issues, not silent heuristics.

## Current Known-Safe Authoring Rules
- Multi-pattern writing: use scaffold-driven `strict` mode; treat descriptor bytes as topology-specific, not synthesized.
- For multi-pattern leader writes, activate/append in full-body space first; trim only where the validated branch requires it.
- Event types are preset-driven with slot constraints; Track 1 remains constrained to `0x25` in known-good authoring paths.
- Type transitions (`0x05` -> `0x07`) must preserve structural alignment rules (no stale padding).

## Top 3 Next Actions
1. Complete pointer-tail / pointer-21 decode so inspector can emit trustworthy `step` and `gate` for all event forms.
2. Consolidate remaining open descriptor/handle questions for non-`T1` topologies and expand scaffold captures.
3. Continue promoting stable findings from logs into canonical subsystem docs (`header`, `events`, `pretrack`, `track_blocks`).
